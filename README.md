Pyventory - A pet project that's currently 100% broken. :)
=============================================================
**Uses Python 3.4 and Django 1.7 and a whole lot of love**

### Bugs:
* Everything!

### TODO:
* Ticket: Show linked comments in detail view.
* Servers: During CreateView add attribute 'contains' as a form element, then find+link via form_valid override.  
* Inventory objects will need detail views and more heart later on.
* Get human/recent/core from all apps and send them to git as new repo.
* Tickets: self.name, find the right balance of len().
* Tickets: Merge both ticket forms (add create.html), but on create hide the element and keep the set-new override.
