Pyventory - A pet project that's currently 100% broken. :)
=============================================================
**Uses Python 3.4 and Django 1.7 and a whole lot of love**

### Bugs:
* Everything!

### TODO:
* Just imported the old ticket code, gotta fix it up real purrty
* Servers: make 'resides_in' attr, use form attribute to capture during create/update and search+attach in view. OR put
 a find+link method in the model. 
* Merge old cctrl code into ticket as attribute and a dash of business logic.
* Get human/recent/core from all apps and send them to git as new repo. 
* Inventory objects will need detail views and more heart later on.
